MuSEEK: Multi-dish Signal Extraction and Emission Kartographer
=============================

**MuSEEK** [muˈziːk] is a flexible and easy-to-extend data processing pipeline for multi-instrument autocorrelation
radio telescopes. It takes the observed (or simulated) TOD in the time-frequency domain as an input and processes it
into **healpix** maps while applying calibration and automatically masking RFI. The data processing is parallelized using **ivy**'s parallelization scheme.

The **MuSEEK** package has been developed at the `Centre for Radio Cosmology` at `UWC` and at the `Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics` at `UoM`.
It is inspired by **SEEK**, developed by the `Software Lab of the Cosmology Research Group <http://www.cosmology.ethz.ch/research/software-lab.html>`_ of the `ETH Institute of Astronomy <http://www.astro.ethz.ch>`_.

The development is coordinated on `GitHub <http://github.com/cosmo-ethz/seek>`_ and contributions are welcome. The documentation of **MuSEEK** is not yet available at `readthedocs.org <http://museek.readthedocs.io/>`_ .
